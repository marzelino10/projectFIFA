PROJECT FIFA



Project FIFA is my first personal project focusing on analyzing FIFA World Cup datasets created by Jahaidul Islam on Kaggle, which are:
1. FIFA World Cup 1930-2022 All Match Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahaidulislam/fifa-world-cup-1930-2022-all-match-dataset)
2. FIFA World Cup All Goals 1930-2022 Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahaidulislam/fifa-world-cup-all-goals-1930-2022-dataset)
3. FIFA World Cup Award Winner 1930-2022 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahaidulislam/fifa-world-cup-award-winner-1930-2022)

Here I utilized SQL to extract insights I need from the tables, some of which are:
a. Which team has played the most matches and won the most in the World Cup?
b. Does being a World Cup host boost the team performance?
c. Which player has won more than 1 award?
